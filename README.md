# Online demo for Javascript projects

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jiro Jasmin and I am a French junior web developer.  
This repository is for demo purpose only.  
I use it to host my static projects with Github Pages.  

You can start navigating through the projects from the homepage here:  

ðŸš€ **[jiro-jasmin.github.io](https://jiro-jasmin.github.io)** ðŸš€  

Or if you prefer, you can access to each project demo here:  

- [Snake Game](https://jiro-jasmin.github.io/js_snake) (Object-Oriented-Programmation with native Javascript)
- [My Movie List](https://jiro-jasmin.github.io/js_todolist) (Improved To Do List with native Javascript)
- [Choose Your Character](https://jiro-jasmin.github.io/jquery_charac) (animation made with jQuery)

More projects are coming and will be added to this list.
