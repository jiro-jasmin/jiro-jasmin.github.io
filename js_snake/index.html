                let's play to one of the most famous arcade games ever: <br>the snake game!
            </p>
            <p>
                the rules are super simple: <br>you are a moving snake that can't be stopped! <br>
                <strong>use the arrow keys of your keyboard</strong> to control directions and eat the most apples.
                if you hit the wall or yourself, you loose!
            </p>
            <p>ready ? <br>click on the start button below!</p>
            <button id="start" aria-label="start the game">start</button>
            <p>
                please note that this game is currently only available on desktop devices,
                as you need a wide screen and a keyboard to play.
            </p>

                <li>the 'eating sound' and the game over melody come from universal-soundbank.com.
                    they got recorded from some atari games (but there is no more information about it...).

            <p>
                the coding was made by jiro jasmin (me) and got inspired by different resources online (like any dev
                projects). it's all javascript native, and a bit of html and css.
