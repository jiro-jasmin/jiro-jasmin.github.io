# Snake Game 🐍

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is a remake of a classic arcade and mobile video game: the snake game  🐍  
You control a snake (which cannot stop moving forward) with the arrows on your keyboard and you need to eat the most apples. You loose if you collide yourself or a wall!  
For now, the game is only available on desktop device (you need a wide screen and a keyboard).
