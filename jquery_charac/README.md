# Choose your character 🧍

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is a single-page jQuery animation 🎬  
Navigate between five 3D characters, by clicking on them or on their name. On mobile, the animation changes to a carousel.  
This component could be use for an online videogame app, but also for any business which proposes to the user different subscription plans (which could be displayed the same way with this animation).
